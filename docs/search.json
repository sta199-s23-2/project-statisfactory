It was intended to provide information about national substance abuse in different demographics to better understand public health and guide policy.\nThis data shows substance abuse across different age groups and states in the U.S. The types of substances include cigarettes, marijuana, cocaine, and alcohol use. It includes the population of the users in three different age groups in different years, as well as the totals and rates of the different substance uses in each age group."

    "text": "Research question\nHow do the quantities of people with alcohol use disorder in the last year aged 12-17 compared to 18-25 differ across states?\nThis question is important because it draws attention to how youth substance abuse trends differ across regions of the United States. The resulting conclusions may guide targeted and more effective policy to more rural or urban states (depending on the results). Having an understanding of what regions have larger populations of youth with substance abuse disorders can also guide future studies that explore the cause of those discrepancies (types of jobs, income, ethnicity, etc.).\nThis research topic will compare the number of teenagers (12-17) with substance abuse disorders to young adults (18-15) by state. This involves first comparing the numerical (quantitative) data from the \"Totals.Alcohol.Use Disorder Past Year.12-17’’ observation column to the \"Totals.Alcohol.Use Disorder Past Year.18-25\" column. After general trends are observed in substance use disorders across age, we can look at how these trends are magnified or intensified in certain states or regions. To do this second level of analysis, we will use the categorical observation column called \"State\" (which holds Strings) to compare increases/decreases in substance use disorders across states. We may even group states into regions (eg. southeast, northeast…) to get a broader understanding of the distribution of substance use disorders across the country. We hypothesize that there will be a consistent increase in substance use disorders between the 12-17 group and the 18-25 group, but this jump will be more dramatic (bigger increase) in states with large urban hubs known to struggle with high crime rates (including NYC, Chicago, Detroit, Baltimore, and St. Louis). \nOur three variables will be Totals.Alcohol.Use Disorder Past Year.12-17 (Quantitative - Integer), otals.Alcohol.Use Disorder Past Year.18-2 (Quantitative - Integer), and State (Categorical - String)."

PMID: 34396554.\nProvide a one paragraph summary about the article.\nThe prevalence of substance abuse disorders has been largely considered a public health crisis, particularly with the rise of opioid overdose deaths in 2016. In the United States, the majority of the population will partake in some use of substances, and among users, nicotine, alcohol, and cannabis are the most common drugs of choice. In terms of nicotine consumption, while cigarette smoking has declined significantly in the past few decades, nicotine and cannabis vaping had risen over 2-fold by 2017. There was a brief dip in alcohol consumption, followed by large increases in the past decade, part of which the authors suggest may have been caused by the increased accessibility and time throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Cannabis use has increased, especially with the rise of legalization across US states. After cannabis, opioids and then heroin were the most common illicit substances, both of which are linked to high rates of overdose. Experts are shifting to understand substance abuse disorder as characterized by neurobiological and social risk factors.\nIn 1-2 sentences, explain how your research question builds on / is different than the article you have cited.\n\nAs research focuses more on the balance between biological and environmental factors, it becomes increasingly important to understand the nuances of situational factors - such as location.

The variables include race, age, gender, armed vs not armed status, location, and if the person killed had a mental illness.

Findings may indicate that younger people of certain races are targeted with disproportionate police violence, which could lead to a push for police reform. Investigating the intricacies of police violence through the lens of race and age is crucial to identifying systemic issues in the criminal justice system.\nThe research topic seeks to investigate if young people of minority races are targeted with more police violence. We will analyze the variables “Person.Age,” “Person.Race,” and “Shooting.Manner” to narrow down which demographic experiences “shot and Tasered” vs “shot.” We hypothesize that minority victims (African American, Hispanic, Native American, other) are more likely to be shot and tased (experience more violence) at a younger age than white victims.\nThe age variable is quantitative, and the race and shooting manner variables are categorical."

Data was sourced from the Washington Post repository on fatal police shootings between 2015-2020, which is dependent on curated news reports and thus may exclude necessary data such as gender and minority status. During this time interval, 5367 fatalities were recorded, 4740 presented with significant racial data for analysis, and 4653 included both sufficient racial and age data for YLL calculation. Contrary to popular hypotheses, while there was a small decline in deaths of white victims, there was no significant trend in death rates among all other race/ethnic groups (i.e. rates were stable across the 5 year interval). In order, mean deaths pqpm were as follows: highest among Native Americans (1.74), then Blacks (1.49), Hispanics (0.74) , Whites (0.57), and Asians (0.25).

This wealth gap however has not been heavily scrutinized with regards to the super-wealthy. It is common knowledge that there are many more male than female billionaires.

The data largely comes from Forbes World’s Billionaires list from 1996-2015. Thus far, they have identified three significant trends: 1) wealth is growing faster in emerging markets; 2) wealth is trending towards increasingly self-made; 3) there are large regional differences in wealth trends. In the US, for example, extreme wealth is more likely to be the result of financial and investing endeavors, while European wealth continues to be, for the most part, inherited. The authors also argue that rather than the combined net worth of billionaires rising as a consequence of current billionaires acquiring more wealth, it is more likely that these numbers come from the increase of total billionaires worldwide. The study of billionaires and the accumulation of wealth is important to understand global wealth distributions and income inequality, as well as allowing experts to suggest means of potential redistribution and benevolent problem-solving targets. \nIn 1-2 sentences, explain how your research question builds on / is different than the article you have cited.\n\nThe cited article attempts to explain the rise of billionaires with the sources of wealth, such as the regions from which billionaires are sourced, and how it was made (self/inherited, market).
